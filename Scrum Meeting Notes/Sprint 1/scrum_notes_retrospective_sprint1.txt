Meeting Minutes:

    - First we talked about what went wrong during the sprint?

    Some people talked about how they waited till towards the end to start working instead of working on it gradually throughought the sprint.
    
    Talked about how some of our Jira tasks weren't specific enough making it difficult to actually mark them off as completed. Talked about how 
    we will make sure to be more specific with tasks in the future to avoid this.

    - Next we talked about what went right during the sprint?

    We talked about how we did a good job with the meetings whether that be related to scheduling them, but also just making sure they actaully happened.
    Overall we also had good communication throughought the duration of the sprint. 

    Talked about how we did a good job with splitting up the work and following through on that for the most part. 

    Also all staisfied with the overall result of the sprint, with all pages having working MVPs.

    - What changes should be made to procedure?

    Talked about agreeing to work on things more consistently throughought the duration of the sprint instead of all towards the end.

    - Explanation of goals not met if applicable

    We were a bit ambitious with the amount of tasks we assigned and the work associated with them due to us not being specific enough
    with what was required to mark them as complete. This led to some tasks being not fully complete even though a large part of them may have been.
